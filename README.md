# sbcourses

## Getting Started

In order to start working on sbcourses, clone the repository and install dependencies using
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Note: There is also a `setup-workspace` script that downloads UCSB's API docs
and generates their typescript types.

```
git clone https://github.com/btk5h/sbcourses.git
cd sbcourses
yarn install
yarn setup-workspace
```

This project uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the app locally in development mode:

```
yarn start
```

To build the production version of the app to the `build` folder

```
yarn build
```
